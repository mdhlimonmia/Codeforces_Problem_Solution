5. Contiguous Integers: The expression n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) + 1 results in a perfect square. This outcome is based on the product of four consecutive integers and holds true for specific values of n.

6. Perfect Squares: For any positive integer n, the difference n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n - 1 represents an odd number. That is, the difference between the squares of two consecutive integers is always an odd number.

7. Sum of First n Natural Numbers: The formula 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 denotes the sum of the first n natural numbers and can also be interpreted geometrically as the area of a trapezoid.

8. Fermat's Little Theorem: If p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).

9. Divisibility Rules:
        Divisibility rules for various numbers are very useful. 
        For example, a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
        And, A Number is Divisible by 9 if the Sum of its Digits is Divisible by 9

10. Goldbach's Conjecture: 
        According to this conjecture, every even integer n ≥ 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
        And every odd integer can be expressed as a sum of three prime number. But if num-2 is prime then two prime number.

11. Congruences: The expression a ≡ b (mod m) means that a and b leave the same remainder when divided by m. This concept plays a significant role in solving various number-theoretic problems.

12. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
If m1, m2, ..., mk are pairwise coprime positive integers and a1, a2, ..., ak are any integers, then the system of congruences x ≡ ai (mod mi) has a unique solution modulo M = m1 * m2 * ... * mk.

12. Sum of Divisors Function:
The function σ(n) denotes the sum of all positive divisors of a number n, and it plays an important role in various mathematical problems.

14. Euler's Totient Function:
Euler’s Totient Function is used to count the number of integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It is particularly significant in number theory and cryptography.

15. Prime Numbers:- 
    A prime Number is a number that has exactly two factors- 1 and itself.
    EX: 2, 3, 5, 7, 17, etc.

    Fun fact: The product of two prime numbers always has 4 divisors.
    Example:
    6 --> 1, 2, 3, 6
    15 --> 1, 3, 5, 15

16. Armstrong Number:-
    An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
    EX: 1, 
        153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3, 
        1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4

17. If any number has only three positive divisors, then the number has to be the perfect square of a prime number.
    EX: 4 = 2^2; Divisors of 4 = 1, 2, 4
        25 = 5^2; Divisors of 25 = 1, 5, 25

18. Palindrome Number:-
    A palindromic number is a number that is the same as its reverse form.
    EX: 123321, 1111, 1331, etc.

19. Digital Root:-
    The digital root of a number is the single-digit value we get by repeatedly adding the digits of a number until we reach a single digit.
    It's also known as the digital sum or seed number.
    EX: 221 --> 2 + 2 + 1 = 5
        698 --> 6 + 9 + 8 = 23 --> 2 + 3 = 5

    Fun fact:- DR = remainder when the number is divided by 9 (Number % 9). [If number % 9 = 0 and 𝑛umber ≠ 0, then DR = 9.]

20. Simplest but important rules of number theory:-
    - Perfect Squares Have an Odd Number of Total Divisors.
    - Any Two Consecutive Numbers are Co-prime. [gcd(n,n+1)=1]
    - The Product of Two Consecutive Integers is Never a Perfect Square.
    - Any Power of an Odd Number is Odd. [odd^𝑛 = odd]

21. Any even number will be one if( num = |num - 2^x| ) where x = 29 to 0
    And every odd number will be zero if (num = |num - 2^x|) where x = 29 to 0;
